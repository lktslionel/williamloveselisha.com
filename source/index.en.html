                                        In Europe for several years, I have had the opportunity to meet many nice, courteous, hospitable, exemplary people...etc. But she, Elisha Eliud, was the meeting with myself, for here is finally the one who is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.

                                            My beloved, my "coco caramélisé"

                                            I remember we were on a flight together to Italy, we were going to seek the Lord at a retreat. It was the second time we saw each other (well the first, I don't know what to say except that we had just greeted each other at the beginning of a retreat)</p>
                                            <p>I remember we were walking down the stairs of a Mall in Berlin after having tasted that first meal (Rice with minced meat)</p>
                                            <p>I remember all of Eis's dishes on the table in front of us in an Eiscafé in Bremen (She likes creams...)</p>
                                            <p>I remember the mailman standing outside with boxes of surprise orders (She had prepared everything to accompany me in this challenging time when my dad was saying goodbye).</p>
                                            <p>I remember our first photo shoot in the woods of an abandoned town in Sauerland (I was the Photographer himself) after a retreat that marked a new point for you and me. You were so beautiful, and today, you are even more so.</p>
                                            <p>I remember the pastor saying to me, "You have to shepherd the sheep, but you also have to have your eyes open" (He could see everything I couldn't see yet).</p>
                                            <p>I remember the separation after this retreat which was not so easy... This perfume that you gave off was beginning to bury me...</p>
                                            <p>I remember those calls that lasted minutes, hours and more and more... Your stories, tenderness, voice and, of course, the peace that your soul gave off...I was gradually melting into it. </p>
                                            <p>Your consecration and your fear for the Lord began to mark my spirit strongly.</p>
                                            <p>Your maternal warmth could not leave me more resistant.</p>
                                            <p>This was the atmosphere that Father prepared and orchestrated around me. The atmosphere in which I was going to recognise as Adam, the one who was going to be the bone of my bones and the flesh of my flesh... </p>

                                            <p>
                                                I love you very much my love and I am very happy that I was able to acknowledge and make this choice, to marry you. 

                                        </p>

                                        <h3>To the love of my life</h3>
                                        <p>
                                           I met my dear Axel, the love of my life, in September 2016 at a spiritual retreat here in Germany. 
After that first meeting, we continued to cross paths at retreats.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Our relationship eventually developed into a true friendship over time. 

                                            At this point, I considered Axel as a big brother who would counsel, talk with, and pray for me and me. 
                                                                                        
                                            I greatly admired his dedication and devotion to Christ, the wisdom that came from him, and his humility and respect for others, but that was nothing more! 
                                                                                        
                                            I remember thinking at the time that having a husband like him would probably be boring because I felt he was too serious and spiritually rigid. Hahaha: the sarcasm of life.
                                        </p>
                                            
                                        <p>
                                            Time passed and life's challenges presented themselves: school difficulties, disappointments, deaths, etc. 
                                            and our friendship became even deeper and stronger. 
                                            At some point, my feminine senses alerted me to a change in frequency. 
                                            You know, as women, we know when someone is starting to be attracted to us romantically and I could sense that happening with him. 
                                            
                                            He had always been nice to me, but now he was even nicer, more attentive and more intentional in his actions.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            At the same time, my relationship with the Lord underwent a major revival and I had a complete renewal of my person. 
                                            
                                            One thing led to another, and after months of fasting and prayer, tears and laughter, turmoil, but most of all, an intense love, passionate and God-ordained love for each other, I said yes to my lover.
                                        </p>

                                            Comme le veut notre coutume, les fiançailles aussi appelées “Toquer de porte” ont été faites après que nos familles aient été informées de nos projets. 
                                            La famille d'Axel s'est rendue chez mes parents à Yaoundé, pour " toquer à la porte ". 
                                            Ils ont annoncé leurs intentions et discuté des perspectives d'union des deux familles par le mariage. 
                                            Cet acte atteste la bénédiction des parents pour notre projet de mariage.

                                        <p>
                                            For I have found him whom my soul loves (Song of Songs 3:4) Axel knelt down in front of the Eiffel Tower on the Alexander 3 bridge on a cold night in Paris, and it was the simplest YES I've ever said. 🥰
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            At that time, we were already in the middle of wedding preparations, so the proposal with a ring was just a formality since I had already given him my YES a few months before in front of my parents and our families had already met. However, my beloved knew it was something that had to be done and so he found the most romantic way possible to do it, in Paris, the city of love! ♥️
